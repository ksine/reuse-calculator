# CalculatorReuse

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.4.

To run this project:

1) clone the repository to your desired location
    `git clone git@github.com:ksine/reuse-calculator.git`
2) run `npm install`
3) run `npm start`
4) navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to view the app and perform math operations on 2 numbers

This library was exceptionally easy to integrate. I had no issues using the defined methods, they were intuitively named
and functioned as expected. All I had to do was npm install and import it into my application to be able to use it.
